# Exposure-Time-Calculator

The Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) is a tool to calculate the integration time or some observational error of an observation. The ETC consists of three ETCs: 
  * ETC - IAGPOL of the IAGPOL instrument
  * ETC - SPARC4, the SPARC4 instrument 
  * ETC - Camara Direta of the Camara Direta instrument.

The Exposure Time Calculator - IAGPOL (ETC - IAGPOL) is a tool to estimate the integration time needed to achieve a given polarization error or ) the polarization error obtained from a given integration time, being that in both cases the magnitude of the star is given. The ETC will work for the IAGPOL instrument installed at the [Pico dos Dias Observatory](http://lnapadrao.lna.br/OPD) (OPD) managed by the National [Laboratory of Astrophysics](http://lnapadrao.lna.br/) (LNA) of the [Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication](http://www.mctic.gov.br/portal) (MCTIC).

The Exposure Time Calculator - SPARC4 (ETC - SPARC4) is a tool to estimate the integration time needed to reach a given polarization or magnitude error or the polarization or magnitude error obtained from a given time of integration, and in both cases the magnitude of the star is given in each of the four operating bands of the instrument.The ETC will work for the SPARC4 instrument, still in development.

The Exposure Time Calculator - Camara Direta (ETC - Camara Direta) is a tool to estimate the integration time needed to reach a given magnitude error or the magnitude error obtained from a given time of In both cases, the magnitude of the star is given. The ETC will work for the Camara Direta installed at [Pico dos Dias Observatory](http://lnapadrao.lna.br/OPD)(OPD) managed by the [Laboratory of Astrophysics](http://lnapadrao.lna.br/) (LNA) of the [Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication](http://www.mctic.gov.br/portal) (MCTIC).

The ETC was created in [PHP](http://www.php.net/) using the [MVC architecture](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC). In addition to these technologies, [JSON](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [HTML5](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [CSS3](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS3) and [JavaScript](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) were used.

The ETC is available [here](http://www.inpe.br/etc/)
